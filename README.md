# Smart Street Lighting System 🌃💡

A **Smart Street Lighting System** using **ESP32 (Arduino IDE)** that automates street lights with the help of **IR sensors** and an **ESP32 microcontroller**.  
This system helps reduce energy consumption by keeping lights **ON only when needed**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Automatically turns **lights ON** when motion is detected at night.
- Keeps lights **dim or OFF** when no motion is detected.
- **Daytime auto-off** – lights remain OFF during the day.
- **Energy efficient** and ideal for **smart city infrastructure**.
- Can be expanded with **IoT platforms (ThingSpeak, Blynk, etc.)** for monitoring.

## 🛠️ Components Used
- **ESP32 / NodeMCU** (microcontroller)
- **IR Sensor** (motion detection)
- **Relay Module** (for controlling lights)
- **LED Bulbs / Street Light Models**
- **Power Supply**

---

## 🔧 How It Works
1. During **nighttime**:
   - When motion is detected → Lights turn **ON**.
   - When no motion → Lights remain **dim/ OFF**.
2. During **daytime**:
   - Lights remain **completely OFF**.
3. Reduces **energy consumption** and supports **eco-friendly cities**.
