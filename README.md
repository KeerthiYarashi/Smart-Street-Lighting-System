# Smart-Street-Lighting-System
Smart Street Lighting System using ESP32 (Arduino IDE)
This project automates street lights using IR sensors and an ESP32 microcontroller programmed via the Arduino IDE. The system turns lights brightly ON at night when motion is detected, and keeps them dim or OFF when there's no motion. During the daytime, the lights remain OFF completely. This intelligent lighting system helps reduce energy consumption and is ideal for smart city and energy-efficient infrastructure
