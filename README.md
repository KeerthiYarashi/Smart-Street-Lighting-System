# Smart-Street-Lighting-System
Smart Street Lighting System using ESP32 (Arduino IDE) This project automates street lights using IR sensors and an ESP32 microcontroller programmed via the Arduino IDE. The lights turn ON only when motion is detected, reducing energy consumption. This simple yet effective system is ideal for smart city and energy-saving applications.
